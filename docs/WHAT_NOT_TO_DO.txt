                    ENIGMA ENGINE - WHAT NOT TO DO
================================================================================

This guide lists common mistakes and things to avoid when using Enigma Engine.

================================================================================
                           1. MODEL MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

DON'T: Delete model folders directly from file explorer
  WHY: The registry.json won't be updated, causing errors
  DO: Use the GUI's Model Manager or registry.delete_model()

DON'T: Train the same model simultaneously from multiple processes
  WHY: Weights will be corrupted, training will fail
  DO: Wait for one training session to complete before starting another

DON'T: Manually edit weights.pth files
  WHY: Binary files will be corrupted beyond repair
  DO: Use grow/shrink functions or retrain from scratch

DON'T: Use special characters in model names (except underscore)
  WHY: May cause file path issues on some systems
  DO: Use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only
  EXAMPLE: "my_ai_v2" is good, "My AI (v2)!" is bad

DON'T: Train with extremely high learning rates (>0.01)
  WHY: Model weights will "explode" and become NaN
  DO: Start with 0.0001 and increase gradually if needed


================================================================================
                           2. TRAINING DATA
================================================================================

DON'T: Train on empty or near-empty data files
  WHY: Model won't learn anything useful
  DO: Ensure at least 50-100 lines of quality training data

DON'T: Use training data with inconsistent formatting
  WHY: Model will learn the inconsistencies
  DO: Keep format consistent (Q/A pairs, dialogues, or plain text)

DON'T: Include harmful, illegal, or private content in training data
  WHY: Model will learn and reproduce this content
  DO: Review training data before use

DON'T: Mix languages randomly in training data
  WHY: Model gets confused, outputs gibberish
  DO: Either train on one language or use clear language markers

DON'T: Train for too many epochs (>1000) on small datasets
  WHY: Model will overfit and just memorize data
  DO: Use early stopping or validation loss monitoring


================================================================================
                           3. HARDWARE & RESOURCES
================================================================================

DON'T: Run large models (>256 dim) on Raspberry Pi without checking RAM
  WHY: System will freeze or crash from out-of-memory
  DO: Use tiny/small presets for Pi, or check available RAM first

DON'T: Train without GPU while using large batch sizes
  WHY: Training will be extremely slow (hours instead of minutes)
  DO: Use batch_size=1 or 2 on CPU, larger on GPU

DON'T: Interrupt training in the middle of saving weights
  WHY: Weights file will be corrupted
  DO: Wait for "Saving checkpoint..." messages to complete

DON'T: Run multiple GPU-intensive processes simultaneously
  WHY: Out-of-memory errors, crashes
  DO: Train one model at a time on GPU


================================================================================
                           4. GUI & INTERFACE
================================================================================

DON'T: Click "Train" repeatedly while training is in progress
  WHY: Multiple training threads cause chaos
  DO: Wait for current training to finish

DON'T: Close the GUI while training is running
  WHY: Training will stop abruptly, may corrupt checkpoints
  DO: Use "Stop Training" button first, then close

DON'T: Load excessively large files (>100MB) into the training data editor
  WHY: GUI will freeze and become unresponsive
  DO: Split large files or edit them outside the GUI

DON'T: Spam the send button in chat
  WHY: Queue builds up, responses become delayed/mixed
  DO: Wait for each response before sending the next message


================================================================================
                           5. API & NETWORKING
================================================================================

DON'T: Expose the API server to the public internet without authentication
  WHY: Anyone can use your AI, waste your resources
  DO: Use localhost only, or add authentication

DON'T: Send requests with extremely long prompts (>10000 characters)
  WHY: May cause memory issues, timeout
  DO: Keep prompts under 2000 characters for best results

DON'T: Run the API server and GUI at the same time on the same model
  WHY: Both try to access the same model file
  DO: Use one interface at a time, or use different models

DON'T: Hardcode IP addresses in client code
  WHY: Won't work when IPs change
  DO: Use discovery service or configurable addresses


================================================================================
                           6. VOICE & AVATAR
================================================================================

DON'T: Enable voice features without required packages installed
  WHY: Errors and crashes
  DO: Install pyttsx3, speechrecognition, vosk first

DON'T: Use speech recognition in noisy environments
  WHY: Poor accuracy, gibberish input
  DO: Use a good microphone, reduce background noise

DON'T: Expect the avatar stub to do anything
  WHY: It's a placeholder for future integration
  DO: Implement your own avatar backend (Unreal, Unity, etc.)


================================================================================
                           7. FILE OPERATIONS
================================================================================

DON'T: Store conversations in the same folder as model weights
  WHY: Cleanup scripts might delete important files
  DO: Use the designated data/conversations/ folder

DON'T: Run the AI from within the enigma/ package folder
  WHY: Relative imports break
  DO: Run from project root: python run.py

DON'T: Edit __init__.py files unless you know what you're doing
  WHY: Import structure breaks
  DO: Leave package structure alone


================================================================================
                           8. VERSION CONTROL
================================================================================

DON'T: Commit large model files (>100MB) to Git
  WHY: Repository becomes huge, cloning takes forever
  DO: Add models/ to .gitignore, use Git LFS for large files

DON'T: Push API keys or passwords to public repositories
  WHY: Security risk - anyone can use your credentials
  DO: Use environment variables or config files in .gitignore


================================================================================
                         9. MODEL ROUTER / HUGGINGFACE
================================================================================

DON'T: Train HuggingFace models from the GUI
  WHY: HF models are pre-trained, Enigma training only works on Enigma models
  DO: Use HF models as-is, or fine-tune using HuggingFace tools

DON'T: Load 7B+ models on Raspberry Pi
  WHY: Not enough RAM, will crash or be extremely slow
  DO: Use small models (Qwen2-0.5B, TinyLlama-1.1B, DialoGPT-small)

DON'T: Delete HuggingFace models from ~/.cache/huggingface manually
  WHY: Registry and cache can get out of sync
  DO: Use the "Delete HF Model" button in Model Manager

DON'T: Assign the same model to conflicting tools with different configs
  WHY: Can cause unexpected behavior
  DO: Use consistent settings for each model


================================================================================
                         10. CAMERA TAB
================================================================================

DON'T: Start camera without OpenCV installed
  WHY: Will show error messages, no functionality
  DO: Install first: pip install opencv-python

DON'T: Leave camera running when not needed
  WHY: Uses CPU resources, heats up the Pi
  DO: Stop camera when done, it saves resources


================================================================================
                           SUMMARY: GOLDEN RULES
================================================================================

1. ALWAYS backup before major changes (growing/shrinking/deleting models)
2. NEVER edit binary files (weights.pth) manually
3. ONE training session at a time
4. MATCH model size to your hardware
5. REVIEW training data before use
6. WAIT for operations to complete before starting new ones
7. KEEP models and data organized in their proper folders
8. TEST changes on a backup before applying to your main model
9. USE Router tab to assign models to tools (Apply to All for quick setup)
10. PREFER small HuggingFace models on Pi (Qwen2-0.5B is recommended)
