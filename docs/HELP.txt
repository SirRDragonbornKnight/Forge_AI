   Each AI has separate history:
   - Conversations saved in models/<name>/brain/conversations/
   - Includes timestamps and message counts
   
   Tips:
   - Sessions auto-save when you close the chat
   - Use descriptive names when saving manually


6. INSTRUCTIONS TAB
-------------------
   Purpose: Configure AI personality and behavior.

                         MULTI-AI COMMUNICATION
================================================================================

Enigma supports running multiple AI models that can communicate:

1. Load multiple models through the Model Manager
2. Each model runs in its own context
3. Use the API to route messages between models

Example: Have "Luna" (creative AI) talk to "Nova" (technical AI)

Code example:
   from enigma.core.inference import EnigmaEngine
   
   luna = EnigmaEngine(model_name="luna")
   nova = EnigmaEngine(model_name="nova")
   
   # Luna asks Nova a question
   question = luna.generate("What should I ask the technical AI?")
   answer = nova.generate(question)
   # Luna responds to the answer
   response = luna.generate(f"Nova said: {answer}")


================================================================================
                         TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

GUI WON'T START
---------------
   - Check PyQt5 installed: pip install PyQt5
   - Try: python -c "from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication"
   - On Linux, may need: sudo apt install python3-pyqt5

TRAINING IS SLOW
----------------
   - Reduce batch size to 1 or 2
   - Use smaller model (tiny/small)
   - Check if GPU is being used (CUDA)
   - Reduce number of epochs

AI GIVES BAD RESPONSES
----------------------
   - Need more/better training data
   - Try training for more epochs
   - Check training data quality
   - Increase model size if hardware allows

VOICE NOT WORKING
-----------------
   - Install: pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition
   - For STT: pip install vosk sounddevice
   - Check microphone permissions
   - On Linux: sudo apt install espeak

SCREEN CAPTURE FAILS
--------------------
   - On Linux: sudo apt install scrot
   - On Wayland: May need special permissions
   - Try: pip install mss pillow

OUT OF MEMORY
-------------
   - Use smaller model size
   - Reduce batch size
   - Close other applications
   - Use CPU instead of GPU (slower but works)
