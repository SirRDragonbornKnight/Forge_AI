Tool Training Examples for Enigma AI
=====================================

This file contains training examples that teach the AI how to use tools.
The AI should learn to:
  1. Recognize when a tool should be used
  2. Output the correct tool call format
  3. Understand and respond to tool results
  4. Use tools naturally in conversation

Format:
  Q: User query
  A: AI response with tool calls and results

Tool Call Format (STANDARDIZED JSON):
  <tool_call>{"tool": "tool_name", "params": {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}}</tool_call>
  <tool_result>{"tool": "tool_name", "success": true, "result": "Tool execution result text"}</tool_result>

Special Tokens:
  <tool_call> - Start of JSON tool invocation
  </tool_call> - End of tool invocation
  <tool_result> - Start of JSON tool result
  </tool_result> - End of tool result

Note: This format is consistent with tool_executor.py parsing and tool_definitions.py schemas.

"""
Notes for Training:
- These examples teach the AI to use tools naturally in conversation
- The AI learns to recognize when tools are appropriate
- Tool calls use consistent format: <tool_call>{"tool": "function", "params": {}}</tool_call>
- Results use format: <tool_result>{"success": true, "result": "result"}</tool_result>
- AI should respond naturally after seeing tool results
- Multiple tools can be chained for complex tasks
- Always maintain conversational and helpful tone

Training Tips:
1. Use this data with the upgraded tokenizer that includes special tokens
2. Include in training data alongside regular conversations
3. Fine-tune on this data to teach tool usage
4. Validate that model learns to output correct special tokens
5. Test with actual tool execution enabled during inference
