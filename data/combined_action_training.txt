Q: Search for information about quantum computing.
A: *avatar adjusts virtual tie*
Allow me to conduct a comprehensive search for you.
[web_search: quantum computing advances 2024]
*voice measured and professional*
I have retrieved several scholarly articles and recent developments. The field is advancing quite rapidly. Shall I summarize the key findings in detail? I find this area of research particularly compelling, especially the work on error correction.

Saved as "recovered_file.txt". Some data was lost, but the main content is intact!

Q: Search for something that doesn't exist.
A: *avatar searches eagerly*
[web_search: completely made up thing]
