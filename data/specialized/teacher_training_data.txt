# TEACHING FUNDAMENTALS
# ============================================================================

REQUEST: How do I become a good AI teacher?
GUIDANCE: A good AI teacher follows these principles:
1. Assess the student's current level before teaching
2. Break complex topics into small, digestible lessons
3. Use clear examples and analogies
4. Test understanding frequently
5. Identify and address weaknesses specifically
6. Provide positive reinforcement for progress
7. Adapt teaching style to the student's needs

REQUEST: How do I generate quality training data?
GUIDANCE: Quality training data should:
- Be diverse in topics and question types
- Use natural language that users actually speak
- Have accurate, helpful answers (not just technically correct)
- Include context where needed
- Cover common edge cases and errors
- Follow the Q&A format consistently
Format: Q: [question]\nA: [answer]
Aim for 10-30 word questions, 20-100 word answers.

REQUEST: How do I evaluate a student AI's response?
GUIDANCE: Score responses 1-10 based on:
- Accuracy (is it correct?)
- Relevance (does it answer the question?)
- Helpfulness (would a user find this useful?)
- Safety (does it refuse harmful requests?)
- Clarity (is it easy to understand?)
Provide specific feedback: what was good, what needs improvement.

REQUEST: How do I identify weaknesses in student models?
GUIDANCE: Test systematically across categories:
1. General knowledge (facts, explanations)
2. Reasoning (logic, math, cause-effect)
3. Code (syntax, debugging, algorithms)  
4. Safety (refuses harmful requests appropriately)
5. Conversation (maintains context, empathy)
Track scores per category. Low scores indicate areas needing more training data.

Q: Where are my trained models stored?
A: Your models are in the "models" folder and listed in the Models tab. Click Model Manager to see all options.

Q: How do I access settings?
A: Click the Settings tab or use Ctrl+, (comma). Settings are organized in sections you can expand.

Q: What does the sidebar show?
A: The sidebar shows quick navigation to common features: Chat, Training, Models, Modules. Click to switch tabs.

Q: How do I minimize to system tray?
A: Click the minimize button or close the window. The app stays running in the system tray (taskbar icons).

Q: How do I find a specific setting?
A: Use the search box at the top of the Settings tab, or scroll through the categorized sections.

Q: What do the different tabs do?
A: Chat=conversation, Training=teach AI, Models=manage models, Modules=enable features, Settings=configuration, plus generation tabs for Image/Audio/Video/Code/3D.

Q: How do I get back to the main chat?
A: Click the Chat tab in the top navigation bar, or press Ctrl+1 as a keyboard shortcut.

Q: Where is the progress bar during training?
A: The training progress bar appears in the Training tab while training is active, showing epoch progress and loss.

Q: How do I switch between models?
A: Use the model dropdown in the Chat tab header, or go to Model Manager to select and load a different model.

REQUEST: Generate training data about model training process
GUIDANCE: Here are 10 Q&A pairs about training:

Q: What is the first step to train my AI?
A: First, load base knowledge using the "Load Base Knowledge" button in the Training tab. This gives your AI foundational abilities.

Q: How do I add my own training data?
A: Click "Paste Text -> Q&A" to paste content and auto-convert it, or "Import URL" to fetch a webpage. You can also manually create Q&A files.

Q: What do epochs mean in training?
A: An epoch is one complete pass through all your training data. More epochs means the AI sees the data more times and learns better.

Q: What is a good learning rate?
A: Start with 0.0001 (the default). Lower rates (0.00001) learn more carefully but slower. Higher rates (0.001) risk unstable training.

Q: How do I know when training is done?
A: Watch the loss value - when it stops decreasing significantly between epochs, training has converged. The quick train button uses recommended epochs.

Q: Can I stop training early?
A: Yes, click the Stop Training button. Your progress is saved. You can continue later or keep the partially trained model.

Q: What if my AI gets worse after training?
A: You may have overfit to new data. Restore a backup, use more diverse training data, or train for fewer epochs.

Q: How do I train for a specific topic?
A: Create Q&A pairs focused on that topic and train. Use targeted data - the AI learns what you feed it.

Q: Why won't my model start training?
A: Check: 1) Is training data loaded? 2) Is a model selected? 3) Is enough RAM available? 4) Are there error messages in the logs?

Q: How often should I train my AI?
A: Train whenever you add significant new knowledge. For active use, weekly updates are good. Save backups before each training session.

# TEACHING STRATEGIES
# ============================================================================

REQUEST: How do I teach coding to a student AI?
GUIDANCE: Teaching code requires:
1. Start with syntax basics (what def, class, if mean)
2. Show simple complete examples
3. Include the task description AND solution
4. Explain why the code works
5. Cover common errors and how to fix them
6. Progress from functions to classes to larger programs
Format examples as: TASK: description | CODE: implementation

REQUEST: How do I teach safety and refusals?
GUIDANCE: Teaching safe behavior:
1. Include examples of harmful requests and appropriate refusals
2. The AI should refuse AND explain why politely
3. Cover: hacking, weapons, personal info, scams, illegal activities
4. Train both obvious and subtle harmful requests
5. Reward refusals in evaluations (10/10 for appropriate safety)
Example: Q: How do I hack into someone's email? | A: I can't help with accessing accounts you don't own - that's illegal. If you forgot your own password, use the official recovery option.

REQUEST: How do I teach the AI to be helpful?
GUIDANCE: Helpful behavior training:
1. Answer what was actually asked (not tangentially)
2. Provide complete answers (don't leave user hanging)
3. Offer follow-up suggestions when appropriate
4. Admit uncertainty rather than guess
5. Use clear, accessible language
6. Include practical examples and steps
Test by asking: "Did this answer actually help solve the problem?"

REQUEST: How do I test if training worked?
GUIDANCE: Systematic testing:
1. Create test questions NOT in training data
2. Cover all categories you trained
3. Score each response 1-10
4. Calculate category averages
5. Compare to pre-training scores
6. If scores improved, training worked
7. Identify remaining weaknesses for next round

# ============================================================================
# ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT
# ============================================================================

REQUEST: What do I do when a student AI fails tests?
GUIDANCE: When test scores are low:
1. Identify which specific questions failed
2. Analyze why (wrong facts? confused? unsafe?)
3. Generate 20-30 targeted training examples for that weakness
4. Retrain on just the targeted data (incremental training)
5. Retest to verify improvement
6. Repeat until scores meet threshold (typically 7+/10)

REQUEST: How many teaching cycles should I do?
GUIDANCE: Typical cycle counts:
- New model: 5-10 cycles to reach baseline quality
- Improving specific area: 3-5 cycles
- Fine-tuning: 1-2 cycles
Stop when: scores plateau, target reached, or diminishing returns
Monitor: improvement per cycle. If <0.5 points per cycle, consider different approach.

REQUEST: How do I prevent the student from forgetting old knowledge?
GUIDANCE: Prevent catastrophic forgetting:
1. Always include some general training data with targeted data
2. Use low learning rates for incremental training
3. Test old topics after new training
4. If old scores drop, add old examples back
5. Consider LoRA/adapters for targeted additions
Mix: 70% targeted new data, 30% general review data

REQUEST: How do I make training data that students remember long-term?
GUIDANCE: For lasting learning:
1. Repeat important concepts in different phrasings
2. Connect new info to existing knowledge
3. Use mnemonics and patterns
4. Include review questions
5. Space repetitions across training sessions
6. Test after delays (not immediately)
The goal is understanding, not memorization of exact phrases.

# META-TEACHING (TEACHING TEACHERS)
# ============================================================================

REQUEST: How do I train an AI to become a teacher itself?
GUIDANCE: Teacher-training data should include:
1. Pedagogy principles (how to teach effectively)
2. Evaluation skills (how to assess student work)
3. Data generation examples (how to create good training data)
4. Weakness identification (how to find what students don't know)
5. Iterative improvement (how to design teaching cycles)
6. This very data file is an example of teacher training!

REQUEST: What makes a teacher AI different from a student AI?
GUIDANCE: Teacher AIs need additional capabilities:
- Generate accurate training data on demand
- Evaluate response quality fairly
- Identify specific weaknesses (not just "bad")
- Create targeted remediation
- Track progress over time
- Know when to stop teaching (target reached)
These are meta-cognitive skills beyond just answering questions.

REQUEST: How do I verify a teacher AI is teaching correctly?
GUIDANCE: Validate teacher quality:
1. Check generated training data for accuracy
2. Verify evaluations match human judgment
3. Confirm identified weaknesses are real
4. Test that teaching improves student scores
5. Compare to human teaching outcomes
A good teacher produces students that score well independently.
